- **Selecting and Filtering Data:** Selecting data based on a time range and specific conditions.
- **Group Aggregations:** Calculating aggregated values (minimum, maximum, average price) by groups.
- **Joins:** Joining tables based on common keys to obtain complex data.
- **Unique Selection:** Selecting unique values and sorting based on specific criteria.
- **Filtering by Record Count:** Grouping data and filtering based on the number of records in each group.

## SQL Operations - Sample SQL Code in Practice

- **LEFT JOIN:** Joining two tables where all data from the left table and matching data from the right table are included.
- **INNER JOIN:** Joining two tables based on matching records in both tables.
- **Subqueries:** Using subqueries to get record counts or maximum values based on the main query.
- **Conditional Selection:** Selecting data based on specific conditions (e.g., price list validity).
- **Distinct:** Selecting unique values without duplicates.

These SQL operations encompass a wide range of techniques for manipulating data and creating complex queries in PostgreSQL and Oracle databases.
